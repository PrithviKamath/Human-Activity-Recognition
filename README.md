Final Project <br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b>: Predict Human Activity and classify them into WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING </br  >
</br  >
<b>Dataset</b>: Human Activity Recognition </br  >
7352 observations with 128 datapoints taken within 2.56 seconds with 50% carry forwarded in the training dataset. Each datapoint has 9 measurements for:</br  >
•	Body Acceleration X axis </br  >
•	Body Acceleration Y axis </br  >
•	Body Acceleration Z axis </br  >
•	Body Gyroscope X axis </br  >
•	Body Gyroscope Y axis </br  >
•	Body Gyroscope Z axis </br  >
•	Total Acceleration X axis </br  >
•	Total Acceleration Y axis </br  >
•	Total Acceleration Z axis </br  >
 </br  >
<b>Goal</b>: </br  >
•	Showcase that Standard Neural Networks shouldn’t be used to predict Sequential Classification Problem </br  >
•	Implement Deep Neural Networks and prove it to be better than Standard Neural Network for Sequential Classification Problem </br  >
 </br  >
<b>Steps Completed</b>: </br  >
•	Importing data </br  >
•	Exploratory Data Analysis </br  >
•	Implementing Machine Learning algorithms </br  >
 >o	Decision Tree </br  >
 >o	K Nearest Neighbors </br  >
 >o	SVC </br  >
 >o	Gaussian Naïve Bayes </br  >
 >o	Quadratic Discriminant Analysis </br  >
•	Implementing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with keras</br  >
•	Implementing Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) with tensorflow</br  >
•	Created Android App to track Human Activity using Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors</br  >
 </br  >
<b>Results</b>: </br  >
LSTM has a better accuracy at predicting the human activity as compared to any machine learning algotihm or even RNN. RNN has 81.81% accuracy where as LSTM has 88.97% accuracy</br  >
 </br  >
<b>Future Scope</b>: </br  >
•	Inclusion of third variable to improve prediction accuracy </br  >
•	Android App enhancements with user better interface </br  >
•	Implement flask API to display output on a remote server </br  >
